# The Measuring Tool Stand

![The Measuring Tool Stand](Images/Image1.jpg)

I got tired of all my measuring tools laying in a heap on my desk so I drew up this stand to keep them all organized and in a smaller footprint.

Designed specifically for FDM, all the parts print without support and should fit on most printer beds.

Made to specifically fit the products shown (linked below).
